Create a simple script that uses recursion and back tracking - brute force - in order to print the result.
In our solver, each one of the four drawings has a number from 1 to 4 where Head = +1 ; Tail = -1
Each tile is then recognised by: Name='p1', Used already in the puzzle = False, Northern edge=+1, East=-4, South=+2, West=-2.
